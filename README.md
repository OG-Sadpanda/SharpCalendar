# SharpCalendar
Retrieve Outlook Calendar Details using Cobalt Strike's Execute-Assembly. 
Sometimes its nice to know if/when someone will be out of office :D

Help: SharpCalendar.exe -h

OPSEC: Tool uses Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook.. will spawn a temporary Outlook process to retrieve calendar entries if Outlook is not already open.

Note: Do your own testing with this tool and all my other tools... mileage may vary based on your environment. I am not responsible if something bad happens.
